# Dracomelette
Adds a new item, the Dracomelette, that will fully restore your hunger and give you Absorption 4, Resistance 3, and Regeneration 4 for a minute and a half. To obtain the Dracomelette, place a Dragon Egg on top of a Magma Block, and every so often, the Dragon Egg will pop out a Dracomelette. Each time it does this, however, the egg has a 33% (configurable) chance of being destroyed. The player also has a 50% (configurable) chance to teleport after eating a Dracomelette. The Ender Dragon can also drop eggs even after the first time it is killed (disabled by default).
